This is our chronal calibration exercise or fondly known as addThemUp

We figured out we need to get a bunch of numbers and add them up.

- initial calibration, maybe 0
- get those bunch of numbers
- add them all up to my initial calibration
  - start with the first number and loop through them all
    - keep track of the sum/total
- return the total
